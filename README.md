# CS32-Project1

This project is a basic video game involving various Actors and a Game Board. I was provided with most of the source code in a single main.cpp file and
I modularized it into 13 .c and .h files to make it better organized and more readable. However, I also implemented the previous.h and previous.c modules
which allows the game to keep track of players' previous moves.
